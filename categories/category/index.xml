      <description>I have just installed Ubuntu16.04 today, and preparing to say good-bye to my Win8.1. It is not the newest Ubuntu version and it is not the first time I install it. What keeps me stay with Windows is that some important software, like TIM, Weixin Enterprise are only avaliable on Windows platform.
With 120GB SSD installed, Running Windows virtual machine on Linux is a practical option now. Thanks to the reimbursement, I shall also have 20GB RAM avaliable with new memory installed.</description>
