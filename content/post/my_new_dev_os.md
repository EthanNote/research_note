I have just installed Ubuntu16.04 today, and preparing to say good-bye to my Win8.1. It is not the newest Ubuntu version and it is not the first time I install it. What keeps me stay with Windows is that some important software, like TIM, Weixin Enterprise are only avaliable on Windows platform.

With 120GB SSD installed, Running Windows virtual machine on Linux is a practical option now. Thanks to the reimbursement, I shall also have 20GB RAM avaliable with new memory installed. The installation is easy but the rest jobs are many.

### Input method
Install fcitx first and then Sougou Pinyin, and re-login or restart desktop manager. Open fcitx settings and make sure Sougou Pinyin has been added into the input method list.

### Web browser
Just install Chrome, Firefox did nothing wrong but I just want Chrome. Better install Switchsharp plug-in to get over the wall.

### Shadowsocks
The Qt GUI client has no 'Global Proxy' option, but you can set system proxy server manually. Chrome plug-in is recommanded.

### Vmware Workstation
It is easy to find and download. Chmod the .bundle file to runnable and execute. Serial numbers are easy to find if needed.
